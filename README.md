we're ditching the old clunky PDFs in favor of our new shiny *online documentation platform*!

Visit https://docs.payone.com/display/public/INT/PAYONE+Integrations for always up to date info and manuals regarding our integrations. We're keeping this repo archived and read-only, but please consider this info now outdated.

This repository holds the manuals to our extensions as PDF files
